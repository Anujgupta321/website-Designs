	<div class="headtext">Level Loop Pile carpet </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/level-loop-carpet.jpg" alt="level loop carpet" title="Level Loop Pile carpet" class="imgscale">
						  </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> A level loop design uses short loops where everything is carefully measured to where the loops are of the same length. This type is a little stiffer but it is perfectly appropriate for high traffic areas where durability and toughness are important.</div>
	
	</div>
			
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext"> Berber Loop Pile carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/berber loop pile carpet.jpg" alt="	Berber Loop Pile carpet " title="Berber Loop Pile carpet " class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> Berber is the most common type of loop pile option you can choose. This means that the fibers are bent into a series of loops. This establishes a durable carpet that resists stains although it does not have as much cushioning as other choices.  </div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext"> Multi level Loop Pile carpet </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/multi-level-loop-carpet.jpg" alt="Multi level loop carpet" title="Multi level Loop Pile carpet" class="imgscale">
						  </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> With a multi-level loop design, the tops of the loops will be varied by height, offering a more appealing design with series of visual flourishes. This is different from a patterned carpet in that all the threads are made into loops instead of just with cuts. </div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext"> Saxony Cut Pile  carpet </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/saxony-carpet-320x240.jpg" alt="saxony cut pile carpet" title="Saxony cut pile carpet" class="imgscale">
						  </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara">The Saxony style is a cut pile option where the fiber ends are cut as evenly as possible. In a Saxony arrangement, the fibers are packed tightly together. This creates a smoother appearance. The fibers are about half an inch high as well. </div>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext"> Textured Cut Pile  carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/textured-carpet .jpg" alt="textured cut pile carpet" title="Textured cut Pile Carpet" class="imgscale">
						  </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> The textured carpet style is another cut pile choice. The yarn used is twisted and then cut meaning the carpet is soft while the surface is twisted enough to create a more casual appearance.The twists are tight enough to offer stain resistance, meaning there is more durability and easier cleaning.  </div>
	
	</div>
			
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Acrylic carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/pic 2.jpg" alt="	Acrylic carpet" title="	Acrylic carpet" class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> Acrylic is made with a wool-like body that has a level of static and stain resistance that makes this variety particularly appealing for areas that might be susceptible to stains, and general wear and tear.  </div>
	
	</div>
		
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Wool carpet </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/pic 3.jpg" alt="	Wool carpet" title="Wool carpet" class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara">  You can always use real wool for your carpet if desired. Wool is appealing for how it features a series of carefully woven fibers that resist dirt. It can resist stains quite well.  </div>
	
	</div>
		
	
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Frieze Cut Pile carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/frieze-carpet-300x300.jpg" alt="Frieze cut pile carpet" title="Frieze cut pile carpet" class="imgscale">
						  </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> The frieze choice uses short fibers that can curl in many directions. This establishes a sturdy look that can hide footprints although it is not necessarily made with heavy foot traffic in mind as too much traffic can cause excess fatigue in the area. It has an informal style and is often referred to as a shag pile carpet.  </div>
	
	</div>
		
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Triexta carpet </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/pic 4.jpg" alt="	Triexta carpet" title="	Triexta carpet" class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara">  Triexta is a synthetic choice that has become popular in many homes with pets and kids. This is thanks to how the fibers are strong and not as likely to tear apart like others. Triexta carpeting is a powerful option but it can also be somewhat expensive, so may not be the best choice for those wishing to keep costs down.  </div>
	
	</div>
		
	
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext"> Pattern (Cut and Looped) Pile carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/pattern-carpet-300x300.jpg" alt="Pattern (Cut and Looped) Pile carpet" title="Pattern (Cut and Looped) Pile carpet" class="imgscale">
						  </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> A pattern arrangement uses a mix of cut and looped yarn spots. The specific areas where the yarn is looped versus where it is cut are planned out before the carpet is made, and is designed to establish a specific pattern.   </div>
	
	</div>
		
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Nylon carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/pic 5.jpg" alt="Nylon carpet" title="Nylon carpet" class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> Nylon carpeting is a very popular option, due to how strong and durable nylon is. Nylon fiber can resist soil and stay in its same shape for years without warping.  </div>
	
	</div>
		
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Olefin carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="images/olefin carpet.jpg" alt="	Olefin carpet" title="	Olefin carpet" class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> Olefin is a polypropylene compound that was originally used in outdoor situations for how well it can resist moisture. Today, it is used in indoor situations because olefin fibers offer a wool-like texture and are very strong.  </div>
	
	</div>
		
	<div class="box">
	
	<div class="headtext">	Polyester carpet  </div>
	
	<div class="img"> <img src="./images/pic 1.jpg" alt="Polyester carpet" title=" Polyester carpet" class="imgscale">
					 </div>
	
	<div class="tocpara"> Polyester carpeting is another popular option for those seeking toughness and durability in their floor coverings â€” without compromising on style. A prominent synthetic material, polyester can resist stains.  </div>
